This repository contains a build script that automatically publishes
[CSL](http://citationstyles.org) styles and locales to the Sonatype OSS
repository. The artifacts are mainly meant to be used together with
[citeproc-java](https://michel-kraemer.github.io/citeproc-java/).

The build script is executed daily. Results can be viewed here:
